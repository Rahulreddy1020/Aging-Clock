# Aging-Clock

## Introduction 
- Biological age refers to the physical and functional state of an individual's body as they age, which may be different from their chronological age (i.e., the number of years since their birth).
- Biological age can provide valuable insights into an individual's health status and their risk of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
- There are various biomarkers that can be used to assess biological age, as well as  DNA methylation, telomere length, and circulating proteins.
- Age-related changes in the body can lead to an increased risk of age-related diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.
